# Sound Queue

PWA SoundCloud 'clone' to implement some missing SoundCloud features  
Mainly the ability to queue songs on iOS devices

Allows for queueing and simple playback of SoundCloud songs

Unfortunately, the official SoundCloud API is unusable without an existing registered App  
SoundCloud has cutoff app registration for the forseeable future, so I am unable to properly authenticate
in order to load premium songs
